Potential Modifications:

- maybe make activities box and measurement period box separate bubbles in a flex box so they are side by side on wide enough screens.

- Could add color if "entered" value is > a certain amount after end date to say the user entered the values late, if wanted. 

- Require multiple activity types? ( incentivizing users to fill out form properly somehow? )


Big TODOs:

1) Handle user saying they are done working on the project, probably a whole page with exit survey 

3) Probably want some kind of system for data back-up and recovery (maybe as simple as csv exports regularly, maybe more involved like back-up database server)

 Look into automatically backing up database.

 Change durations and totalDurations to decimals? or have FE only accept ints.
