2) Admin action:
    ie show all users who haven't submitted in last 'x' amount of time?
    show users with less than 'x' submissions?
    Monitor users,
    show data visualizations...? Maybe per activity type show durations x by utc time?

3) Other Modifications:
- Maybe make users specify only pre-determined time periods, like Mon-Wed and Thu-Fri blocks rather than arbitrary dates.

- make tasks[1] case 2 a select instead of a text area?

- maybe make activities box and measurement period box separate bubbles in a flex box so they are side by side on wide enough screens.

Ask Prof:
    Want to capture what they are doing in sequential order. IE what did they do Monday? 
    (Does  the sequential order matter within a measurement period? (not sure about overlap)). \

Notes from 05/20

Q: will Shefa also handle design process app? 
    A: no

Q: do we even want passwords? Or just have them put in their email? 
    A: No password needed, EXCEPT for admin. 


Note: Show admin view from a measurement period first approach ( maybe make a toggle between user first and measurement period first )

Show in a bigger way the hours FOR the block (IE Mon-Wed is 24 hours), so they see how many hours they have entered compares to that. 


Big TODOs:

5) Change admin dashboard to view across measurement periods, (one idea is show table / grid like view where measurement periods are headers (show around 5 at a time) and each row is a user where they have color coordinated boxes under each measurement period showing green if they have filled that one out, or red if not. Show a differeent color for all periods BEFORE a user's first ever green, and show a different color for after a user has indicated they no longer work on the project. )

6) Handle user saying they are done working on the project, and display this color coded on the admin dashboard
