Potential Modifications:

- maybe make activities box and measurement period box separate bubbles in a flex box so they are side by side on wide enough screens.

- Could add color if "entered" value is > a certain amount after end date to say the user entered the values late, if wanted. 

- Require multiple activity types? ( incentivizing users to fill out form properly somehow? )


Big TODOs:

1) Handle user saying they are done working on the project, probably a whole page with exit survey 

2) if user submits a second report for the same measurement period should we:
    a) keep both and reference both
    b) combine all new activities (in case they forgot one)
    c) replace whatever they have entered previously with the new entry
    d) not allow it 
    e) (probably best) have them tell us record is already found and ask if they want to add to it or replace it, then do that
    ??? For Prof 

3) Probably want some kind of system for data back-up and recovery (maybe as simple as csv exports regularly, maybe more involved like back-up database server)

ALSO ask professor for estimate of final number of users.
